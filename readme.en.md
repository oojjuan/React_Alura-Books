# Fullstack Project | Alura-Books
My first fullstack project, where I created both Frontend and Backend from start, based on the content provided during the Alura courses.

## Objective
This project main focus was making me delve deeper into application development, this time in both sides of the coin, the **Fullstack**.

Since its a project focused in learning new things, I made a bunch of comments while coding, helping me understand the code and its logic.

## About
*Alura Books* is an online library, having many different books focused in programming and software development, where the user can search for books and even favorite them if he wants to take a look later.

### Frontend
At the Frontend side, I used the **React** framework to make a more responsive page, using componentization of the code, e routes too, with **react-router**, that made the navigation between different pages of the site possible.

In addition to react, **Axios** was also used to connect Backend with the Frontend.

### Backend
On the Backend side, it was used **Express** to build the server of my application, and to assist on the API testing, I used **Nodemon** to reload instantaneously the application for each modification made, and **EchoAPI** to visualize and make HTTP requests on the API.

Finally, to allow the access of the Frontend with my API, it was necessary the utilization of **Cors**.
